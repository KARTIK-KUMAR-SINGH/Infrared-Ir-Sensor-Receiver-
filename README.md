# Infrared-Ir-Sensor-Receiver-
This project uses an Arduino Uno, a TSOP1738 infrared receiver, and an IR remote to wirelessly control an LED. When a specific button on the remote is pressed, the Arduino reads the IR signal and toggles the LED's state between ON and OFF, allowing simple remote-controlled lighting functionality.
